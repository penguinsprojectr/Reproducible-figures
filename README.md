Reproducible figures coding assignment
--------------------------------------
This is my GitHub for the 'Reproducible Figures' assignment. All files found in the 'Reproducible figures' folder in the repo, the code is the 'RF_project' file, and the 'data' folder is also required in the working directory. No other files should be required.
