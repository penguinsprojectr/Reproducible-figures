Reproducible figures coding assignment
--------------------------------------
This is my GitHub for the 'Reproducible Figures' assignment. All files found in the folder in the repo, the code is the 'RF_project' file, and the 'data'+'functions' folders also required should be placed in the working directory. No other files should be required.

Note: After sending my code to my partner for review, I realised I forgot to save the functions in a separate file, so I edited the code and sent it back to them. This is why I deleted the files and reuploaded.
